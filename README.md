The hOCR Embedded OCR Workflow and Output Format

## About

This repository contains the [hOCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOCR) format
specification originally written by [Thomas Breuel](https://github.com/tmbdev).

Legacy [version 1.1](./1.1/spec.md) is a mostly faithful version converted from
the May 2010 edition hosted on [Google
Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QQnIQtvdAC_8n92-LhwPcjtAUFwBlzE8EWnKAxlgVf0/preview).
It will not be developed further as of September 2016.

The current [version 1.2](http://kba.github.io/hocr-spec/1.2/) is backwards-compatible
but will potentially change in structure and wording.

## Contribute
